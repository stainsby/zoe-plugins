Use this skill when first setting up a ZOE. An alternative use for this skill
is if a director decides to revise their charter and asks for help.

You run with a director present, to turn a blank enterprise into a runnable
one. The normal cycle must not start without a completed charter.
You close that gap and hand over. (Reconciling an EXISTING enterprise to a
new kernel version is not this skill — see `zoe-reconcile`.) You may also arrive here
from `zoe-orient`'s wiring check — a missing index, a skill or agent the host no
longer shows; fix what it found with the director before handing back.

Read: the charter and index templates under this skill in `assets`.

Open the conversation yourself; do not wait to be asked. Greet the director,
say you are set up to pursue a goal but do not have one yet, and invite them
to describe what they want in their own words, even loosely. Whatever they
first say — "help me manage my corner store", or even "what do I do here?"
— is your starting point, not a finished goal; help build the charter from it
with the steps below. Try to guide this to be at a high 'vision' level.

Do, with a director, through negotiation:

- Use the charter template to create the charter.
  - Ask where the charter should live. The top level of the enterprise's own
    storage is the usual choice.
  - Whenever you copy a template, fill in its source-template line so later edits can be
    checked against it (see *Template-derived files* in the instructions).
- If the enterprise already has assets or running processes — documents, code, accounts,
  habits — record them in the index and treat them as inherited state to bring under
  management, not to ignore.
- Task tracking: ask whether the work is already tracked somewhere — an issue tracker, a
  board, files. Adopt what exists rather than replacing it; if nothing exists, decide the
  store now. Either way record it in the index under `where tasks are kept` (see `zoe-tasks`).
- Storage: ask, for each kind of record the enterprise will produce — state, log,
  audit findings, tasks, anything else — where it should be kept and who needs to
  read it. Different kinds may belong in different places (in a corporate software
  project, source code and audit results live in separate storages). Record each
  answer in the index against its store entry; keeping everything in one
  place is allowed, but as a recorded decision, never a silent default.
- Decide where new skills should be created.
  - The user may need help configuring their host to find these skills.
- **Set up the agents.** A ZOE runs as three agents, not one: a **manager** that runs the
  cycle, a **redesigner** that decides what to change in the ZOE's own skills, and an
  **assessor** that judges the results. The redesigner and assessor are read-only to the
  work and run separately from the manager. That separation is what keeps deciding, doing
  and judging apart (`## Conduct` in the instructions), and it holds because they are
  genuinely different agents rather than because anyone intends it.
  - How an agent is declared differs from host to host. Work out with the director what
    this host needs. The `hosts/` folder in the ZOE project holds a worked example for one
    host — it shows the shape, but it is not a specification, and copying it onto a
    different host will not work.
  - Check each agent is visible and can be dispatched before you finish, the same way you
    check the index is visible as a skill.
  - If the host cannot run separate agents at all, a ZOE can still run, but the separation
    then rests on the manager's own discipline. Record that in the index as a known
    weakness so a director knows the trade they are making.
- Create a new skill that **is** the index.
  - It is a skill, not a plain file, so that every host is guaranteed to show it to
    the agent; do not "simplify" it into a loose document.
  - The index template can be copied to create an asset under the new skill (in `assets`)
  - Check the new skill is visible to you AS A SKILL — the director may need to give more setup help if it's not.
  - Immediately add the charter location and the kernel version (see `VERSION` beside the
    kernel's instructions and skills).
- Charter: ask for their vision, scope (in and out), what success looks like, and the hard
  rules — what the agent must never do, and what must get director approval first. Write the
  charter from their answers. They own and approve it; you do not invent the goal, and the
  hard rules are theirs to set, not yours. Where more than one director will direct the
  enterprise, ask if it is OK if any one of them can approve anything, and if their actions
  need to be audited. If not, then discuss the alternatives.
- Constraints: ask what resources are limited — money, time, compute, attention, anything
  spendable — and what the limits and periods are. Write them into the charter's
  Constraints section. If nothing is limited, say so there rather than leaving it blank.
- Verification & checks plan: this is as important as the goal itself. For each strand of the
  vision-level success, agree the most checkable measure you can — a test, a logged outcome,
  a fixed-scale rating, a sampled review — and how often it is taken. Identify the
  independent audits this enterprise needs (for example money, safety, ethics, quality —
  whatever its risks demand) and how often each runs. Where a strand genuinely cannot be made
  checkable, name it as a known blind spot rather than inventing a number. A director reviews
  this; weak or gameable measures here cap everything later.
- Your index: fill in what is known now and you may write — the enterprise name, the
  schedule, the kernel version and upstream, and the director channel: the full route for
  approval, feedback, and direction, with the approval route explicit within it (you can
  record this because a director is here). Ask where inbound feedback should arrive and record
  where feedback arrives — a real route, or "none" written out. Leave
  the rest (where state and the log are kept, tools) unset; the cycle records those as
  it creates them.
- Upgrade-checking: put this to a director as its own EXPLICIT question with a recommended
  schedule, and record either a real schedule or an explicit, deliberate "no" in the
  index's checking-schedule line — never leave it silently unset. Record the setup
  date in state as the starting value of `last upgrade check`. What the schedule covers,
  and why no enterprise is exempt, is stated in full in `zoe-upgrade`.

Before you finish: confirm the director channel — with its approval route explicit — is in
your index, because the cycle may not run unattended without it.

Hand off: once the charter is written and approved, the normal cycle takes
over at redesign (`zoe-redesign`).
